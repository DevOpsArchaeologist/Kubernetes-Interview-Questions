What is a Kubernetes Pod?
A Pod is the smallest deployable unit in Kubernetes that encapsulates one or more containers.

How do you scale a Kubernetes Deployment?
Use kubectl scale --replicas=[n] deployment/[deployment-name].

What is the difference between a Deployment and a StatefulSet?
Deployments manage stateless applications, while StatefulSets manage stateful applications with stable network identities.

What are DaemonSets used for in Kubernetes?
DaemonSets ensure a copy of a Pod runs on all or some nodes.

How does Kubernetes handle container failures?
Kubernetes automatically restarts containers through Liveness and Readiness Probes.

What is the role of etcd in Kubernetes?
etcd is a key-value store used as the backing store for all Kubernetes cluster data.

How do you perform a rolling update in Kubernetes?
Update the image in the Deployment or use kubectl set image.

What is a Namespace in Kubernetes?
A Namespace is a way to divide cluster resources between multiple users or teams.

What is a ConfigMap?
ConfigMaps are used to decouple environment-specific configuration from application code.

What is the role of a Service in Kubernetes?
A Service defines a stable IP and DNS name to access Pods.

What is the difference between ClusterIP, NodePort, and LoadBalancer Services?
ClusterIP is internal, NodePort exposes services on nodes' IP, and LoadBalancer provisions an external IP.

What is a Kubelet?
Kubelet is an agent running on each node that ensures containers are running as expected.

What is the function of Kube-proxy?
Kube-proxy manages network rules for Kubernetes Services.

What is Helm in Kubernetes?
Helm is a package manager for Kubernetes, used for managing charts (pre-configured Kubernetes resources).

How do you roll back a Kubernetes deployment?
Use kubectl rollout undo deployment/[deployment-name].

What is a Kubernetes Ingress?
Ingress exposes HTTP/S routes from outside the cluster to services inside it.

How do you debug a failing Pod?
Use kubectl logs to view logs or kubectl describe pod for more information.

What is a PersistentVolume (PV)?
A PV is a piece of storage in the cluster that has been provisioned for use by Pods.

What is the difference between a PersistentVolume and a PersistentVolumeClaim?
A PersistentVolume represents the physical storage, while a PersistentVolumeClaim requests that storage.

What are Kubernetes Labels?
Labels are key-value pairs attached to objects, used to identify and organize resources.

What is a Taint in Kubernetes?
Taints prevent Pods from being scheduled on certain nodes unless a Toleration is added to the Pod.

How do you perform node draining in Kubernetes?
Use kubectl drain [node-name] to safely evict Pods before node maintenance.

What are Kubernetes Secrets?
Secrets store sensitive information like passwords, tokens, or keys in an encrypted format.

What is the purpose of a Readiness Probe?
It checks if a container is ready to accept traffic.

What is a Liveness Probe in Kubernetes?
It checks whether a container is running and restarts it if it fails.

What is the role of RBAC in Kubernetes?
RBAC controls access to Kubernetes resources based on roles and role bindings.

How do you expose a Kubernetes service externally?
Use a LoadBalancer or configure an Ingress resource.

What is the difference between a Job and a CronJob in Kubernetes?
A Job runs a task to completion, while a CronJob schedules jobs at specific intervals.

How do you check the status of all nodes in a Kubernetes cluster?
Use kubectl get nodes.

What is a Kubernetes ReplicaSet?
A ReplicaSet ensures a specified number of pod replicas are running at all times.

How do you get detailed information about a Pod?
Use kubectl describe pod [pod-name].

What is a Kubernetes Admission Controller?
Admission controllers are plugins that intercept requests to the Kubernetes API for validation.

What is the purpose of kube-scheduler?
The kube-scheduler assigns Pods to nodes based on resource availability and constraints.

What is a nodeSelector?
nodeSelector is a field that restricts Pod placement to specific nodes.

What is a Kubernetes Cluster Autoscaler?
It automatically adjusts the size of the cluster based on resource demands.

How does Kubernetes handle Pod networking?
Kubernetes uses a flat network model where all Pods can communicate with each other, often via CNI plugins.

How do you limit resources for a Pod?
Define resource requests and limits in the Pod's YAML specification.

What are Kubernetes Tolerations?
Tolerations allow Pods to be scheduled on nodes with matching Taints.

What is the purpose of the Kubernetes API server?
The API server is the front end for the Kubernetes control plane, handling all REST requests.

How can you run a one-off command in a running Pod?
Use kubectl exec [pod-name] -- [command].

What is a VolumeMount in Kubernetes?
VolumeMounts are used to mount storage volumes into containers in a Pod.

What is the difference between soft and hard limits in Kubernetes?
Soft limits are resource requests, and hard limits are enforced resource ceilings.

How do you create a Kubernetes namespace?
Use kubectl create namespace [namespace-name].

What is Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA)?
HPA automatically scales the number of pod replicas based on resource utilization metrics.

What is the function of the kube-controller-manager?
It runs control loops that regulate the cluster state, such as Node and Deployment controllers.

What is the use of Kubernetes Network Policies?
Network Policies control traffic flow at the IP address level between Pods.

How do you update a running deployment in Kubernetes?
Modify the deployment manifest or use kubectl set image or kubectl apply.

What is the purpose of the kubeconfig file?
kubeconfig provides authentication information to interact with the Kubernetes cluster.

What is a Sidecar container?
A Sidecar container runs alongside the main container in a Pod to complement its functionality.

How do you schedule a Pod on a specific node?
Use nodeSelector, nodeAffinity, or apply specific node labels.
